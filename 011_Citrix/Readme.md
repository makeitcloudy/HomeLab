## Citrix NetScaler

Consider the Freemium version of the Citrix Netscaler (Citrix ADC), starting version 13.0 of the product, the freemium version equals with the features previous standard releases, so it should at least give you the possibilities to get some hands on experience with SSL offloading, Load Balancing, Context switching, and some other interesting things, without a chance to set the Gateway for your CVAD infrastructure (https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/deploying-vpx/deploy-vpx-faq.html#hypervisor). Let's see what the 2022 bring for home labbers as Citrix is promissing some improvements in that area, and some special licenses / options. Again you may remain with Citrix stack, unless decided that pfsense is your way to go, or another mixture of components.
