OK folks... Letâ€™s talk community, AVD, W365, and having some fun trying out new things. A couple of years ago we introduced the FREE Nerdio Community Edition (NCE), specifically aimed at, well, community, meaning ðŸ«µ If you have your own private tenant, maybe sponsored by Microsoft, your company, yourself, or whatever the case may be, and you would like to try out Nerdio including all bells and whistles, pleaseâ€¦ be our guest, we have 100â€™s running already.
 
No feature limitations, everything is included, and set up in 30 minutes. Send me your install ID, and ðŸ’¥ youâ€™re ready to go and have some fun! Let me know if you would like to learn more. Even all future (monthly) version updates are included for up to 25 users. Say what, Oprah?!
 
Oh, and BTW, if you are a Nerdio partner, small, big, just starting out or maybe you are a seasoned veteran the above applies to all of you as well.

Normally, when Oprah makes an announcement like this books are sold hundreds of thousands at a time, so we will be ready and waiting to take on the load ðŸ˜…
 
Spread the word, happy Friday, and have a great weekend everyone!
